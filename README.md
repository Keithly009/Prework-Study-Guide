# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- This first project is the first step in furthering my education towards a career and knowledgeable future, with this project acting as a stepping stone I will be referring back to this guide time again when I return. 
- I built this project in order to act as something that can help me whenever I need to return to refresh on some of the fundamentals of these basic progamming languages.  
- This solves Basic HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- I learned how to build the fundamentals of a website using HTML, how to decorate the website using CSS, using Git to export it to a remote location where others can view my work, and Javascript to create more advanced content and all encompassing needs for my work.

Using this study-guide is for the purpose of revisiting the concepts that have been introduced prior to the actual classes which seek to build on the foundations of this work. 

This acts as the foundations of my study which I can continuously revisit whenever I choose to.
